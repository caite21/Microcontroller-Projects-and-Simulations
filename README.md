## [Raspberry Pi Pico LED Multiplexing Circuits](https://wokwi.com/projects/402600052539404289)

This project showcases two LED control circuits using the Raspberry Pi Pico C SDK. The top circuit illustrates Charlieplexing (tristate multiplexing), while the bottom circuit demonstrates traditional multiplexing. Two debounced push buttons trigger interrupts to change the LED lighting patterns. You can interact with the simulation by clicking the green play button in the top left corner.
